# Buddy Central
Home Page / Station for all Buddy Apps

**Buddy Central will be expected to launch near late-spring**

## What is Buddy Central?
Buddy Central is a home page where you will be able to access documents from Buddy Docs, songs from Buddy Music, and more, in a single app.
Kind of it as Google Drive or OneDrive, just for Buddy Apps.

## Why was Buddy Central made?
*Buddy Central* was made to not have to go through different tabs to find something in our apps, and also...
because we've seen a problem when it comes to downloading our web apps as an app. **Since our web apps come from the same website domain, the browser would allow you to download for example, Buddy Music as an app, but then think that Buddy Docs is the same web app, since they share the same domain.** So that's why we made Buddy Central.
